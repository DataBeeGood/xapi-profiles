# xapi-profiles
This is a specification that addresses the structure and supporting services for xAPI Profiles.  An xAPI Profile is the human and/or machine-readable documentation used when implementing xAPI in a particular context. 

This Github repository contains the [xAPI Profiles Specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-profiles), which stands as a companion specification to the core xAPI Specification. The core [xAPI Specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) is a learning technologies interoperability specification, which describes learner activity and experiences in a manner that allows sharing and analysis across different systems and contexts, wherever xAPI has been implemented. 

In order to handle specialized Use Cases efficiently and minimize the problem of vocabulary confusion across learning domains, customized xAPI Profiles have become an essential companion for designers and developers.  Each xAPI Profile documents a domain-specific vocabulary and statement template, which controls descriptive data generation and enhances meaningful analytical reporting for learning activities within a particular domain.  In other words, xAPI Profiles are blueprints for a successful, semantically interoperable xAPI implementation.

The xAPI Profiles Specification is divided into three documents:

* Part One: [About xAPI Profiles](./xapi-profiles-about.md)
* Part Two: [xAPI Profiles Structure](./xapi-profiles-structure.md)
* Part Three: [xAPI Profiles Communication and Processing](./xapi-profiles-communication.md)

## Specification versions

The current version of the specification is
[1.0](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles).

## Authored Profiles

ADL maintains a [public repository of authored xAPI profiles](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-authored-profiles) based on this specification and processes provided by ADL's vocabulary and profile index, [http://xapi.vocab.pub](http://xapi.vocab.pub). 

## What to do if the spec is unclear

If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or
unhelpful, you can help to improve the xAPI Profiles specification by
[raising an issue here](https://github.com/DataInteroperability/xapi-profiles/issues). When
raising an issue, please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implementing xAPI Profiles in; what's the use case you
  are trying to achieve? What user stories are you trying to support?
* How you would like the specification to be improved? Suggest some specific new
  wording if you like!
